# A set of useful Github Actions
## Ready-made actions:
- on-push action for pylint (launch linter and styl-checker for Python projects)
    File: `.github/workflows/pylint.yaml`
- on-push action for mypy (type checker for Python projects)
    File: `.github/workflows/mypy.yaml`
## In development:
- on-push action for cpplint (run linter and style-checker for C++ code)
- on-push action for JS (eslint?)
